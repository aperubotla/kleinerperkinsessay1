        <h2>My Chain of Empowerement</h2>
        <p class="text-left">
Even though I was born and raised in the United States, I did not speak English till I was eight years old. I remember going to school and not being able to understand what was happening. I was always inquisitive and not knowing English inhibited my ability to learn. Every day for three years, I practiced my English skills. I sat in the corner of a small apartment in Bloomington, Illinois quietly reading to myself. This perseverance and hard-work always stayed with me. <br>
Now, I am an entrepreneur and public speaker. I am doing things I never imagined I could as a child. I am building my own start-up and writing a book. I want to build a successful start-up and show that dreams are never impossible to achieve. There are so many children who do not speak English and struggle everyday to get through life. I want to show them what is possible and be an example to these children. I see myself in these kids and I see the struggles and the state of confusion they are in. As an entrepreneur and first-generation immigrant, I want to empower these children and guide them to make a difference in their life. <br>
My journey started as a young boy sitting in a classroom struggling to answer questions in English and I want it to end as a chain of empowerment ever-expanding and forever making a difference in young people’s lives. <br>
